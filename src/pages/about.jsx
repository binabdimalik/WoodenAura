        <h3 style={styles.heading}>Our Story â€” 25 Years of Crafting Beauty</h3>
        <p style={styles.text}>
         At <strong>WoodenAura</strong>, we believe furniture should be more than just pieces in a room â€” 
    they should tell a story, evoke warmth, and bring natureâ€™s calm into your home.  
    Founded in the early 2000s, we began as a small family workshop inspired by a love for 
    wood, design, and the art of craftsmanship. Over two decades later, our passion still guides 
    every curve, joint, and polish.
        </p>
         <p>
    Every piece of furniture we craft tells a story â€” of patience, passion, and perfection. 
    Our artisans pour their hearts into every curve and finish, using only the finest 
    sustainably sourced wood. Each design is thoughtfully created to reflect natureâ€™s 
    harmony while meeting the needs of todayâ€™s modern living spaces.
